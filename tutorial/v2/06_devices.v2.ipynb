      "Devices are an important abstraction in ZeroMQ/PyZMQ. You have noticed that in all of our examples, we have required one socket to bind and another socket to connect. We have also mentioned the following rule: **transient sockets should connect and persistent sockets should bind**. What if all of your applications processes are transient? Devices solve this problem by creating a new persistent process to which all your sockets can connect to. But devices also do more than this:",
